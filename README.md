# ⚡️ "COMET" / Domain specific COMpiler for Extreme Targets

The COMET compiler consists of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for sparse and dense tensor algebra computations, a progressive lowering process to map high-level operations to low-level architectural resources, a series of optimizations performed in the lowering process, and various IR dialects to represent key concepts, operations, and types at each level of the multi-level IR. At each level of the IR stack, COMET performs different optimizations and code transformations. Domain-specific, hardware- agnostic optimizations that rely on high-level semantic information are applied at high-level IRs. These include reformulation of high-level operations in a form that is amenable for execution on heterogeneous devices (e.g., rewriting Tensor contraction operations as Transpose-Transpose-GEMM-Transpose) and automatic parallelization of high-level primitives (e.g., tiling for thread- and task-level parallelism).

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation of the COMET compiler can be found [here](https://pnnl-comet.readthedocs.io/).

## Setting up COMET

These commands can be used to setup COMET project:

1) **Install Dependencies** cmake and ninja are required to install the COMET compiler.

2) **Check out LLVM and COMET repos.**  COMET contains LLVM as a git
submodule.  The LLVM repo here includes staged changes to MLIR which
may be necessary to support COMET.  It also represents the version of
LLVM that has been tested.  MLIR is still changing relatively rapidly,
so feel free to use the current version of LLVM, but APIs may have
changed.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pnnl/COMET.git
$ cd comet
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

*Note:* The repository is set up so that `git submodule update` performs a 
shallow clone, meaning it downloads just enough of the LLVM repository to check 
out the currently specified commit. If you wish to work with the full history of
the LLVM repository, you can manually "unshallow" the the submodule:

```
$ cd llvm
$ git fetch --unshallow
```

3) **Build and test LLVM/MLIR:**

```
$ cd comet
$ mkdir llvm/build
$ cd llvm/build
$ cmake -G Ninja ../llvm \
    -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="mlir" \
    -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86" \
    -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
$ ninja
$ ninja check-mlir
```

4) **Build and test COMET:**

```
$ cd comet
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -G Ninja .. \
    -DMLIR_DIR=$PWD/../llvm/build/lib/cmake/mlir \
    -DLLVM_DIR=$PWD/../llvm/build/lib/cmake/llvm \
    -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
$ ninja
$ ninja check-comet-integration # Run the integration tests.
```

The `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG` flag enables debug information, which makes the
whole tree compile slower, but allows you to step through code into the LLVM
and MLIR frameworks.

To get something that runs fast, use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` or
`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` if you want to go fast and optionally if
you want debug info to go with it.  `Release` mode makes a very large difference
in performance.
