``opt-dense-transpose``
=======================

In addition to optimizations for transpose of sparse tensors, COMET also supports optimization for transpose of dense tensors. 
The ``opt-dense-transpose`` pass finds optimal loop ordering and tiling for efficient code generation.
See :doc:`../optimizations/transpose` for more details of this optimization.
